# pr-toxicity
This is the final project for our graduate course Software Quality Assurance. In this project we are using the pull-request dataset provided by Zhang et al. 2020 [1] and the toxiCR tool developed by Sarker et al. 2022 [2] to analyze the toxicity of pull-requests. Our project will utilize natural language processing to answer the following 3 research questions: 
 
1.) What proportion of open source projects contain toxic language?

2.) To what extent does toxic language in pull requests affect their chances of being merged?

3.) What are the characteristics of projects that have toxic language in pull requests?
